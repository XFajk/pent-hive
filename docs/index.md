# üêùPent-Hive

Welcome to the Pent-Hive documentation. This site documents the CLI, the YAML API for Bees, Hives and Queens, and usable examples to help you design and run repeatable pentest workflows.

Quick links:

- Overview and goals: `About`
- Get started: `Quick Start`
- CLI reference: `CLI Docs`
- YAML API reference: `YAML API Docs`
- Examples and labs: `Examples`

If you're the project author (you), focus first on the `YAML API Docs` to finalize the contract before implementing code.
