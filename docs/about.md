# About Pent-Hive

A structured way to organize, automate, and reproduce pentests.

## The Problem

Pentesting usually means writing and running lots of scripts and tools:

- Build a custom exploit or payload
- Run sequences of commands against a target
- Reset/reinitialize the environment to test again

Doing this manually is:

- **Unorganized** – scattered bash scripts or ad-hoc notes
- **Error-prone** – easy to forget steps or mess up order
- **Not portable** – scripts work on *your* machine, but not others

## The Solution

Pent-Hive provides a clean structure with three components:

### Bees → units of work

Each Bee defines:

- `build` → compile/setup tools before execution
- `execution` → execute the actual test/exploit
- `reset` → restore the environment to its pre-test state

### Hives → environments where Bees run

Abstracts away *where* the pentest happens:

- Local (host machine)
- Docker containers
- Remote targets

### Queens → orchestrators

Tie Bees and Hives together into workflows with proper dependencies and error handling.

This way, you can keep pentests **organized, reusable, and cross-platform**.
